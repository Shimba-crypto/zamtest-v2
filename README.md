# OG Bros

A lightweight browser game where you pick a login profile (`zaza`, `harvey`, or `guest`) and try to grow your empire in 30 in-game days.

## Run

Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or serve the folder:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Notes

- Harvey starts with **$10,000,000 cash**.
- Every action advances one day.
- The run ends automatically after day 30.
